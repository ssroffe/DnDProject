# DnD Project

This is a collection of java programs I have written to manage a Dungeons and Dragons campaign.
Currently it contains:
* A class containing a character's information
* A class containing a spell's information
* A character manager program
* A monster class **(INCOMPLETE)**

## v1.0

Basic Character manager.
Contains information for spells

## For the future
I will probably add automatic stat boosts given from classes and races later.
